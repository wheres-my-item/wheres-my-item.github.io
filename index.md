## Walkthrough

#### User login and signup page

A simple mock-up of the login and singup page:

<div class="center"><img src="doc/sign-in-mockup.png" alt="user page" width="950px"></div>

<div class="center"><img src="doc/sign-up-mockup.png" alt="user page" width="950px"></div>

This allows users of the website to create accounts and access user-to-user specific information.

#### User (after Login) page, non-Admin user

Once you log in (either to an existing account or by creating a new one), the navbar changes as follows:

<div class="center"><img src="doc/user-page.jpeg" alt="user page" width="950px"></div>

You can now access the lost item submission form, the lost item list, and the claim form.
